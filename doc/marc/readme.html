<h1>chipwhisperer-marc</h1>

<p>This is my version of ChipWhisperer (git://git.assembla.com/chipwhisperer.git)</p>

<p>You're looking at the first drop of several, please be patient
and give me some time for cleaning up.</p>

<h2>What's different to the original ChipWhisperer?</h2>

<p>Various small improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>UI changes</li>
<li>plugin/script API extensions</li>
<li>performance and bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preprocessing filters</li>
<li>Partitioning modes</li>
<li><strong>(TODO)</strong> Crypto algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>The intention is to stay near the original code base, making all
changes in the least invasive way possible.</p>

<h2>Why a fork?</h2>

<p>I have no write permission to the original repository and can't
contribute directly.  Using the fork I am sharing my work with
the public and also with the ChipWhisperer team.  Hopefully they
will pull them into the main codebase.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks to <em>Colin O'Flynn</em> for making ChipWhisperer open-source.
This extension would not exist otherwise.  Also, because of it, I
learned python, git, and markdown.  Thanks for that!</p>

<p><em>Marc</em></p>
